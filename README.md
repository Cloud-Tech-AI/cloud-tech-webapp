## 🎨 Customization

### Colors and Branding
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize the color scheme:

```javascript
colors: {
  primary: {
    // Your primary brand colors
  },
  secondary: {
    // Your secondary colors
  }
}
```

### Content Management
The website currently uses mock data. To integrate with a CMS:

1. **Replace mock data** in page components with API calls
2. **Add environment variables** for API endpoints
3. **Update TypeScript types** in `types/index.ts`

### Adding New Sections
1. Create components in the appropriate folder
2. Add new pages in the `pages/` directory
3. Update navigation in `components/Header.tsx`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Static Export (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
```
The `out/` folder contains the static files ready for deployment (automatically generated with `output: 'export'` in next.config.js).

### Vercel (Easiest)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `out/` folder to Netlify
3. Configure redirects if needed

### Traditional Hosting
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload contents of `out/` folder to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve the files

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file for environment-specific settings:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILCHIMP_URL=your-mailchimp-endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### SEO Configuration
Update SEO settings in `pages/_app.tsx`:

```javascript
const defaultSEO = {
  title: 'Your Site Title',
  description: 'Your site description',
  canonical: 'https://your-domain.com',
  // ... other SEO settings
}
```
