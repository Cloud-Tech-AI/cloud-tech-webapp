- Use headings, subheadings, and paragraphs to structure your content effectively.
- Apply formatting to text using features like bold, italics, and strikethrough.
- Create lists (ordered or unordered) to organize information.
- Insert hyperlinks to external websites or internal pages within your content.
- Include images using the appropriate Markdown syntax, ensuring the image file is available and correctly referenced.
- Add code snippets or blocks using code highlighting syntax if applicable.
- Preview your Markdown content before publishing to verify its appearance.

For further guidance and reference, you can explore online Markdown editors or consult comprehensive Markdown syntax guides available on the web.
