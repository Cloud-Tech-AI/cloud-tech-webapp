# Cloud Tech Web App - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ESLint Errors - Unescaped Entities
**Problem**: React/JSX was throwing errors for unescaped apostrophes (`'`) in text content.

**Files Fixed**:
- `components/CommunityStats.tsx` - Line 45: "Here's what we've achieved" → "Here&apos;s what we&apos;ve achieved"
- `components/about/AboutHero.tsx` - Line 22: "We're on a mission" → "We&apos;re on a mission"
- `components/about/Community.tsx` - Line 69: "each other's growth" → "each other&apos;s growth"
- `components/about/Mission.tsx` - Line 53: "world's leading platform" → "world&apos;s leading platform"
- `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` - Line 64: "We'll get back" → "We&apos;ll get back"
- `components/contact/ContactHero.tsx` - Line 22: "We'd love" and "let's start" → "We&apos;d love" and "let&apos;s start"
- `components/speaking/SpeakingRequest.tsx` - Lines 67 & 87: Multiple apostrophe fixes

**Solution**: Replaced all unescaped apostrophes with HTML entity `&apos;`

### 2. Next.js Link Errors
**Problem**: Using `<a>` tags for internal navigation instead of Next.js `<Link>` components.

**Files Fixed**:
- `components/blog/BlogCategories.tsx` - Lines 100, 106, 112: Replaced `<a href="/blog/...">` with `<Link href="/blog/...">`

**Solution**: 
- Added `import Link from 'next/link'`
- Replaced `<a>` tags with `<Link>` components for internal navigation

### 3. CSS/Tailwind Typography Error
**Problem**: CSS was using `prose` classes from Tailwind Typography plugin that wasn't installed.

**Error**: `The 'prose' class does not exist` in `styles/globals.css`

**Solution**:
- Installed `@tailwindcss/typography` package
- Added plugin to `tailwind.config.js`: `require('@tailwindcss/typography')`

### 4. Next.js Export Command Deprecation
**Problem**: `npm run export` command was deprecated in favor of `output: 'export'` in config.

**Solution**:
- Removed `"export": "next export"` from `package.json` scripts
- Confirmed `output: 'export'` is already configured in `next.config.js`
- Updated README.md to reflect the change

### 5. Security Vulnerabilities
**Problem**: Next.js version 14.0.4 had critical security vulnerabilities.

**Solution**:
- Updated Next.js from 14.0.4 to 14.2.30 using `npm audit fix --force`
- Resolved all security vulnerabilities
